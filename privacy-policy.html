            </ul>
            <h4><span>2</span> How we collect this information</h4>
            <p>Information is generally collected:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When we ascertain from you the facts necessary to make a fair
                and reasonable assessment of their insurance or financial needs
                and objectives (“Fact Find”);
              </li>
              <li>When you complete an application form for insurance;</li>
              <li>

              <li>
                When you complete supplementary medical or financial
                questionnaires
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you are unable to provide us with your personal information, we
              may not be able to organise for you to receive a product or
              service. You can nominate an Authorised Representative to access
              your personal information. This authority can be revoked at any
              time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Synchron may collect personal information from a third party (such
              as another Financial Adviser, Product Provider or Medical
              Practitioner) or a publicly available source but only if you have
              consented to the collection or it can reasonably be expected that
              consent has been provided by you.
            </p>
            <h6><span>2.1</span> Privacy on the internet</h6>
            <p>
              Synchron and our Authorised Representatives may use websites to
              collect personal information from you. Synchron and Authorised
              Representatives may receive a password and a personal
              identification number to access details online. This information
              will be kept confidential and secure at all times.
            </p>
            <h6><span>2.1.1</span> Cookies</h6>
            <p>
              These are text files stored on a person’s computer when they visit
              a website. Their sole purpose is to identify users and possibly
              prepare customised web pages or to save site login information.
              Synchron and our Authorised Representatives may use cookies on our
              websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cookies can be purged from your browser after every use. This is
              generally a very simple procedure. Please refer to your browser’s
              help file for more information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although Synchron and our Authorised Representatives strive to
              ensure your security, no data transmission over the internet can
              be guaranteed to be completely secure.
            </p>
            <h6><span>2.2</span> Tax File Numbers</h6>
            <p>
              Synchron and our Authorised Representatives may need to collect
              your tax file number to provide you with a product or a service
              (for example, managed fund investments and superannuation
              products). However this information will be kept securely and
              destroy or we will permanently de-identify TFN information where
              it is no longer required.
            </p>
            <h4><span>3</span> What we collect</h4>
            <p>The personal information generally collected includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Name;</li>
              <li>Address;</li>
              <li>Phone number;</li>
              <li>Email address;</li>
              <li>Age details;</li>
              <li>Occupation;</li>
              <li>Financial details;</li>
              <li>Health Details;</li>
              <li>Transaction information;</li>
              <li>Bank account details;</li>
              <li>Tax File Number;</li>
              <li>Income details from employers;</li>
              <li>Details of dependents;</li>
              <li>Beneficiary details.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Where the information is deemed to be sensitive, for example, the
              collection of health information, there will be higher level of
              privacy protection afforded.
            </p>
            <h4><span>4</span> Disclosure of personal information</h4>
            <p>
              There may be cases where Synchron and our Authorised
              Representatives will need to disclose your personal information to
              third parties. This is generally to assist us in providing you
              with a product or service. This may include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Doctors, medical services or other organisation to help assist
                with the collection of information for an insurance application
                or a claim;
              </li>
              <li>
                Any fund (investment administrator or superannuation trustee) to
                which your benefit is transferred, created or rolled over;
              </li>
              <li>
                Your employer where it relates to your employer sponsored
                superannuation arrangement;
              </li>
              <li>
                Your personal representative or any other person who may be
                entitled to receive your death benefit;
              </li>
              <li>
                An external dispute resolution service, insurer or legal
                representative (where required or applicable);
              </li>
              <li>
                The policy owner (where you are the life insurer but not the
                owner);
              </li>
              <li>
                Exchange of information with authorised financial institutions
                to confirm bank account details for payment;
              </li>
              <li>
                Service providers that maintain, review and develop our business
                systems;
              </li>
              <li>
                Regulatory bodies (including the Australian Securities and
                Investment Commission) as required by law.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If required by law or a regulatory body to do so, Synchron and our
              Authorised Representatives will comply and provide the appropriate
              body with the required information.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not currently disclose your personal information overseas.
            </p>
            <h6><span>4.1</span> How we hold personal information</h6>
            <p>
              Your hard copy and electronic records are stored in secure
              buildings and internal information systems.
            </p>
            <h6><span>4.1.1</span> Protecting personal information</h6>
            <p>
              We protect your information by way of staff training, secure
              storage and system security.
            </p>
            <p>
              Synchron will take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify the
              personal information we hold once it is no longer needed for any
              purpose for which it may be used or disclosed.
            </p>
            <h4><span>5</span> Collection of sensitive information</h4>
            <p>
              Where you apply for certain life risk products (such as life
              insurance, income protection insurance, trauma insurance, total
              and permanent disability insurance) it will be necessary for
              Synchron and our Authorised Representatives to collect sensitive
              information about your health. This information will only be
              collected when you give consent by completing the product’s
              application form. The information will be sourced by the Life
              Insurance company from you, your medical professional and by other
              medical professionals where medical tests may have been performed.
              Due to confidentiality, it is sometimes the case whereby Synchron
              or the Authorised Representative may not be made fully aware of
              the medical circumstances by the Life Insurance Company.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unless required by law, we will only collect sensitive information
              with your consent.
            </p>
            <h4>
              <span>6</span> Sale of an Authorised Representative’s business
            </h4>
            <p>
              In the event that an Authorised Representative proposes to sell
              their business, or if an Authorised Representative is no longer
              eligible to provide advice, we may disclose some of your personal
              and sensitive information to potential purchasers for the purpose
              of conducting due diligence investigations. Any such disclosures
              will be made in the strictest confidence and conditional that no
              personal information will be used or disclosed by them. In the
              event of a sale being effected, Synchron or our Authorised
              Representatives may transfer your personal information to the
              purchaser of the business. In this instance, you will be provided
              a notice by mail to your last known mailing address that such a
              transfer will be taking place. You will then have the opportunity

            <h4><span>7</span> Access to personal information</h4>
            <p>
              You are able to access any personal information that is held by
              Synchron or our Authorised Representatives subject to limited
              exceptions or required by law. The following factors will be
              considered:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The information is related to a commercially sensitive decision
                making process;
              </li>
              <li>Access would be unlawful;</li>
              <li>Denying access is required or authorised by or under law;</li>
              <li>
                Providing access would be likely to prejudice an investigation
                of possible unlawful activity.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              To access the information, you will need to contact the Privacy
              Officer as detailed in this policy. You may be charged a small fee
              applicable to the collection and provision of your personal
              information but will be notified of this fee prior to processing
              their request. The Synchron Privacy Officer will be able to advise
              you how long it will take to provide the information. Generally
              however, you will receive the requested information within 14 days
              of the request.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you believe that the personal information we hold about you is
              incorrect, you have a right to request your personal information
              be corrected.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where we are unable to provide you with the information you have
              requested or correct your information, we will inform you and
              explain the reasons why.
            </p>
